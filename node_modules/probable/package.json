It will randomly generate an integer between 0 and one less than the number of \"sides\" you specify. For example, `probable.roll(6)` will return 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n`rollDie` is like `roll`, except 1-based, like traditional dice. `probable.roll(6)` will return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n`pickFromArray` will randomly pick an element of an array that you give it, giving each element equal weight.\n\n`createRangeTable` will create an object for you that represents a table that maps ranges of numbers to outcomes. If you give it\n\n    [\n      [[0, 80], 'a'],\n      [[81, 95], 'b'],\n      [[96, 99], 'c']\n    ]\n\n&mdash; it will create a table in which indexes 0 through 80 map to an outcome of 'a', 81-95 map to an outcome of 'b', and 96-99 map to an outcome of 'c'. You can use its `outcomeAtIndex` to get the outcome for a particular index.\n\nYou can use the `roll` method to randomly select an index covered by the definition (in the example above, 0-99), then return the outcome corresponding to it.\n\n`createRangeTableFromDict` is a wrapper for `createRangeTable` that may be more convenient in some cases. Instead of giving it explicit ranges, you just specify how much probabiity space you want each outcome to take up. The createRangeFromTable above would be created by createRangeTableFromDict if you gave it this dictionary:\n\n    {\n      a: 80,\n      b: 15,\n      c: 5\n    }\n\nThe drawback of this method is that all of the outcomes must be strings.\n\n`createTableFromDef` is another wrapper for `createRangeTable` that takes a table definition that looks like this:\n\n    {\n      '0': 'Nothing',\n      '1-2': 'Poison gas',\n      '3': 'Ruby',\n      '4': 'Bedbugs',\n      '5-7': 'Bag of gold'\n    }\n\nWhere the ranges are the keys of the object (e.g. '1-2') and the values are the outcomes. So, in this case, probable will roll an 8-sided die (with \"faces\" 0-7) and if the outcome is a 1-2, the outcome is 'Poison gas'. If it is a 4, the outcome is 'Bedbugs'.\n\nThese tables can cascade like so:\n\n    {\n      '0-20': 'a',\n      '21-95': {\n        '0-39': {\n          '0-24': 'Bulbasaur',\n          '25-66': 'Squirtle',\n          '67-99': 'Charmander'\n        },\n        '40-55': [\n          'Human',\n          'Dwarf',\n          'Elf',\n          'Illithid'\n        ],\n        '56-99': 'Rock'\n      },\n      '96-100': 'c'\n    };\n\nHere, if a 25 is rolled, probable then will roll on the subtable defined in the outcome. If it rolls a 70, the outcome will be 'Rock'. If it rolls a 35 on the subtable, the outcome is yet another subtable, so it will roll again. Let's say it rolls a 50 for that. The ultimate outcome will then be 'Squirtle.'\n\n`createProbable` is a function that lets you create another instance of probable that uses a random function other than Math.random, such as something constructed with [seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom). Any function that returns a value between 0 and 1 works as the parameter for this function.\n\n`shuffle` and `sample` are like the [shuffle](http://underscorejs.org/#shuffle) and [sample](http://underscorejs.org/#sample) from Underscore, except that it uses whatever random function you provided to `createProbable` instead of `Math.random`.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install probable\n\nTests\n-----\n\nFirst, install mocha if you don't have it installed already:\n\n    npm install -g mocha\n\nThen:\n\n    make test\n\nRun `probable.sample` tests (~11 seconds on a 2015 MBP) with:\n\n    node tests/sample-tests.js\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nISC.\n",
